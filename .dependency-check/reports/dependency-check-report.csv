Alternatively, you can define the regex used for both parameters and ensure they do not overlap to allow backtracking.  ### References  - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j - https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/",NPM,"","","",HIGH,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,"","","",HIGHEST,5,"","","","","","","",""
